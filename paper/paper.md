# Summary

``PyNomaly`` is a Python 3 implementation of LoOP (Local Outlier
Probabilities). LoOP is a local density based outlier detection
method by Kriegel, Kr√∂ger, Schubert, and Zimek which provides
outlier scores in the range of [0,1] that are directly
interpretable as the probability of a sample being an outlier.
``PyNomaly`` also implements a modified approach to LoOP introduced
by Hamlet et. al., which may be used for applications involving
streaming data or where rapid calculations may be necessary.

The outlier score of each sample is called the Local Outlier
Probability. It measures the local deviation of density of a
given sample with respect to its neighbors as Local Outlier
Factor (LOF), but provides normalized outlier scores in the
range [0,1]. These outlier scores are directly interpretable
as a probability of an object being an outlier. Since Local
Outlier Probabilities provides scores in the range [0,1],
practitioners are free to interpret the results according to
the application.

Like LOF, it is local in that the anomaly score depends on
how isolated the sample is with respect to the surrounding
neighborhood. Locality is given by k-nearest neighbors,
whose distance is used to estimate the local density.
By comparing the local density of a sample to the local
densities of its neighbors, one can identify samples that
lie in regions of lower density compared to their neighbors
and thus identify samples that may be outliers according to
their Local Outlier Probability.

``PyNomaly`` includes an optional _cluster_labels_ parameter.
This is useful in cases where regions of varying density
occur within the same set of data. When using _cluster_labels_,
the Local Outlier Probability of a sample is calculated with
respect to its cluster assignment.
